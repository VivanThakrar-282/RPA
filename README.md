# First RPA Project 🤖

This is a basic Robotic Process Automation (RPA) project created using **UiPath Studio**. It is designed as a blank process and serves as a foundational workflow for automation development and experimentation.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **Main.xaml**  
  This is the main workflow file where the automation logic is implemented.

- **project.json**  
  Configuration file that contains metadata, dependencies, and runtime settings for the UiPath project.

## 🔧 Dependencies

The project uses the following UiPath packages:

- `UiPath.Excel.Activities [3.1.0-preview]`
- `UiPath.System.Activities [25.4.4]`
- `UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities [25.10.7]`

> Make sure these are installed in your UiPath Studio for smooth execution.

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ Designed with UiPath's latest **Windows compatibility** project framework.
- ✅ Modular and scalable, ready to integrate advanced automation steps.
- ✅ Follows standard RPA project structure, ideal for beginners to learn and explore.

## 🏁 Getting Started

1. Open **UiPath Studio**.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open the `Main.xaml` file in UiPath Studio.
4. Install missing dependencies if prompted.
5. Run or debug the workflow to understand or enhance it.

## 📌 Notes

- This project currently does not contain complex logic but serves as a base to build future RPA functionalities.
- It is ideal for:
  - Learning and testing UiPath workflows.
  - Creating a reusable automation template.
  - Demonstrating project setup and versioning with Git.
